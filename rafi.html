        <h2> The different one</h2>
        <p> Rafi is a special kind of cat - the honorary kind. Her previous owner didn't want to castrate his dog, but
            also didn't feel like taking care of the puppies that his dog ended up having, and so Rafi was rescued and
            brought to her forever home, where she enjoys cheering along to my mum's favorite football club, and
            stealing sausages directly from the pan when no one's watching. Apparently no one has told her that she is,
            in fact, a dog, as she keeps to get on top of tables and napping on people's laps. As a 30Kg "cat" does.

    <details>
        <p>Rafi was born in 2015 and is a Labrador and Beagle mix. Her full name is Rafiki because I'm a sucker for classic Disney movies.</p>
