        <h2> The playful one</h2>
        <p> Mika joined our household in 2022. He's a very active and playful cat - the only thing that he loves
            doing more than playing with his toys is chasing his sister Athena around the house. He is a furry little
            fella who needs to be brushed almost daily and enjoys napping under the couch. He is also a very picky eater
            - Mr. Fancy Pants only accepts dry food in his bowl!
