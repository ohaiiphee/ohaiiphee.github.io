        <h2> The shy one</h2>
        <p> Snot joined my previous household in 2009. He was a rescue cat, very afraid of other pets and people, and
            used to be a pro hiding from everyone. He slowly warmed up to us, but never really got past the "neutral"
            stage with other pets. He can be described as very poised and regal - can't be bothered asking for
            attention, will ignore you until he decides you're worthy of petting him - but as soon as it'S food time
            he's the loudest and messiest eater of them all.
